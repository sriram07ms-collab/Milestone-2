    "text": "Hi, When we talk about brokerage platforms in India, Groww is one of the top names and is often considered among the No.1 brokers. However, there is one serious issue that I have been noticing for a long time. Whenever we do options buying, the app often lags or hangs, especially during high volatility. This glitch has happened many times and has caused significant losses. I sincerely want to request the Groww team to please look into this issue and bring a new update or improvement in the app",

I sold shares worth ₹15,600, so my remaining investment should be ₹28,402.36. However, the app currently shows only ₹25,697. This creates confusion for users trying to track their investments accurately. It would be great if the app could display the correct remaining investment amount to improve transparency and trust.

    "text": "I would recommend the team to hire manual testers to test the app properly. All orders - mutual fund - onResume and navigating back creates duplicate entries which looks weired how these basic functionalities go to production without testing. Another weird thing is, I exited a mutual fund outside groww. But still could see it as well as an external mutual fund displaying the invested and returns. OmG!!!! Coin is OG level and Grow is in OMG level!!! App should growwww a lot!!!!",
