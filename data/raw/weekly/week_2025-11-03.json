    "text": "groww price alerts are useless. first of all it only valid for 30 days, secondly - you can't view all alerts in a single page. For example if i created an alert for 450rs and if it comes to 445 i won't be able to know unless i remember about this alert. if they are shown in a single page atleast I can see and sell at 445 instead of waiting for 450. share price might come down before reaching 450 right.",
